# Notification Sample App

This is a sample app showing how to create a rich Android notification containing images and actions. 

The app looks like this when it launches:

And tapping "Send Notification" will send the following rich notification:

The detailed message will be whatever the user types into the sample app's EditText, the two buttons display Toast messages when tapped and the timestamp shows the time when the notification was sent.

I created this project after implementing rich notifications for Hootsuite's Android application, to share what I learned during the process. You can find the full tutorial on [Hootsuite's engineering blog](http://code.hootsuite.com/custom-notifications-for-android/).
